# Project 1 â€“ Relational vs Graph Database Performance Comparison

This repository contains the source code and queries for **CS 6010 â€“ Data Science Programming, Project 1**.  
The project evaluates and compares the performance of **relational (MySQL)** and **graph (Neo4j)** databases on two datasets: **Northwind** and **Recommendation**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each dataset has its own folder with SQL and Neo4j queries:

### `northwind/`
- **`sql_queries.sql`** â€“ SQL queries (10 total) implemented on the Northwind relational schema, organized into 6 categories (simple lookups, one-hop relationships, two-hop relationships, aggregation, time-based, and recommendation queries).  
- **`neo4j_queries.csv`** â€“ Equivalent Cypher queries for Neo4j, stored in CSV format for easy loading/execution.  
- **`sql_relational_conditions.sql`** â€“ Schema constraints for the relational version. This script adds primary keys and foreign keys after importing the raw CSV data into SQL tables, ensuring relational integrity between tables (e.g., `orders`, `customers`, `products`, `suppliers`, `categories`).  

### `recommendation/`
- **`sql_queries.sql`** â€“ SQL queries for the Recommendation dataset, organized into 6 categories (simple lookups, one-hop relationships, two-hop relationships, aggregation, time-based, and recommendation queries).  
- **`neo4j_queries.csv`** â€“ Equivalent Cypher queries for graph database evaluation.  
- **`sql_relational_conditions.sql`** â€“ Schema constraints that establish relationships (primary keys, foreign keys, and cascading behavior) between entities such as `persons`, `movies`, `users`, `ratings`, and linking tables like `actedIn` and `inGenere`.  
- **`graph_data_to_SQL_friendly_csv_export_queries.csv`** â€“ Queries that export the graph data into CSV format for importing into SQL.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Relational DB (MySQL)
1. Import the dataset tables (CSV).  
2. Run **`sql_relational_conditions.sql`** to add constraints and enforce relationships.  
3. Execute **`sql_queries.sql`** to reproduce results and measure execution time.  

### Graph DB (Neo4j)
1. Follow the Neo4j dataset guides:  
   - [Neo4j Recommendations Dataset](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/tree/main)  
   - [Neo4j Northwind Dataset](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind)  
2. Load queries from **`neo4j_queries.csv`**.  
3. Measure execution time and compare against relational queries.
